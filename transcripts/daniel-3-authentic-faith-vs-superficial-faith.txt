In Jesus we that we literally have the
opportunity to read your
words Lord you have given us an
understanding of who you are of who
we're called to
be and Lord through your scriptures both
Old and New Testament you
address the very matter of our lives

convicted and encouraged admonished and
lifted up and Lord would we apply what
we're learning today with
joy Lord we remember your People

to bring your people to
yourself so God do a mighty work in them
open their eyes to see Jesus as Lord and
Savior we pray all these things in
jesus' name and everybody said amen amen
well Daniel chapter 3 if you are new
with us we've been going verse by verse
through the Book of Daniel and Daniel is
an incredible Old Testament book it's
filled with fascinating narrative it's
filled with prophecy which has been both
proven and is also future to come it's
filled with history that you can look
back Beyond just biblical sources to
affirm that it is true and we have been
covering throughout the Book of
Daniel the life of this young man a
teenager who is taken from his homeland
in Jerusalem out of Israel after
Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonian Empire
wiped out Jerusalem in 586 BC he takes
Daniel captive Daniel spends years being
trained to be one of the king's
counselors and we find out that Daniel
is an incred incredible man of God's
character who stands for righteousness
and truth even in the face of difficulty
even when he's under
pressure he is a man who worships the
Lord and the Lord alone Daniel
fortunately is not alone in his
community he's got these three guys
Shadrach meach and Abednego and they all
together worship God as God begins to
move in their life and to raise them
into formidable positions within the
Babylonian Empire as Jews and if you've
been with us the last couple of weeks of
Daniel we looked at King Nebuchadnezzar
and Nebuchadnezzar was the head of the
Neo Babylonian Dynasty he reigned for 43
years he was a powerful
King he had great military conquests and
he was also ruthless and rash a man of
Mighty stature in power and a man who
was an infant in his emotional stability
and we'll see that play out King
Nebuchadnezzar has this terrifying and
terrible
dream and he doesn't know what it means
and so he tells his wise men unless
someone can both tell me my dream and
interpret it I'm going to start killing
all of you and he systematically begins
killing the wise men in
Babylon and Daniel goes before the king
and says oh King give me time let me
seek my God who is the living and true
God and he alone will reveal the dream
and sure enough Daniel Shadrach Meshach
and abedo seek God's face in prayer and
God reveals the dream to Dan Daniel and
Daniel also interprets the dream and the
interpretation is about the Neo
Babylonian
Dynasty in the dream Nebuchadnezzar saw
this huge statue and the Head was made
of gold and Daniel tells him you King
are the head of gold God has given you
Authority and power over all the Earth
even the animals come into your kingdom
for the purpose of finding food and
shelter you oh King are great but your
Dynasty will not last
forever and the second part of this
statue the chest and the arms are made
of silver representing the MEO Persian
Empire which would come onto the scene
after the Babylonian Empire and then you
have the waste of bronze and the
midsection of bronze that represents the
Grecian Empire with Alexander the Great
and then you have the legs of iron
representing the Roman Empire which was
to come after Alexander and then you get
to the and this this mixture of clay and
iron representing the future Kingdom
that is to come that will Usher in the
Antichrist at the end of days and the
king is so amazed so in awe that Daniel
could interpret this dream that lets
back up to chapter 2 verse 46 here's
where we'll begin today here is the
King's response to Daniel interpreting
the dream then King Nebuchadnezzar fell
on on his face prostrate before Daniel
and commanded that they should present
an offering and incense to
him the king answered Daniel and said
truly your God is the god of gods the
Lord of kings and a revealer of Secrets
since you could reveal this Secret at
first glance what's going on with
Nebuchadnezzar he's he's worshiping now
Granite he's at the feet of Daniel so
he's a little off but you know hey it's
his first time right
um is what he speaks true yes
100% what he speaks is true the only one
who could do this is the true God he
continues in verse 48 and it says then
the king promoted Daniel and gave him
many great gifts and made him ruler over
the whole province of Babylon the chief
administrator over all the wise men of
Babylon what a significant position for
Daniel literally becoming second in
command in the most powerful Kingdom in
the world at that time verse 49 also
Daniel petitioned the king and he set
Shadrach meach and Abednego over the
Affairs of the province of Babylon but
Daniel sat in the gate of the king or in
other words in the king's court so that
he could advise the king in a moment's
notice
he was the king's go-to guy he was the
one that was called upon when there were
Affairs or matters of state to be
handled Daniel was put in charge and at
first glance it seems as if
Nebuchadnezzar is coming into his own
worship of the god of Israel the true
and living
God but I want us to pay attention to
something today that is so
important I've titled the message
authentic
faith and superficial
faith we all know what authentic means
it's the real deal superficial means it
appears to be the re real deal until you
dive into the details and you find out
it's a fake it's a
fraud and in our own life I know this if
you know the Bible story that we're
going to go through today in chapter
three all of us want to be Shadrach
meach and Abednego no all of us want to
be those men we want to be in their
likeness their character to stand for
truth regardless of what's being thrown
at us but might I encourage you as we go
through this chapter today to pay
attention the only way to
become a man or a woman after God's Own
Heart like those three men is that the
king neb Nebuchadnezzar has to first die
in us because he's in all of us and
here's how we know that look at chapter
3: 1 Nebuchadnezzar the king
made an image of gold whose height was
60 cubits and its width 6 cubits he set
it up in the plain of dura in the
province of
Babylon Nebuchadnezzar you're so
close in the previous chapter it
finishes with him doing what worshiping
or at least
proclaiming that Daniel's God is the
true God and then by the time we get to
chapter 3 we're not exactly sure how
much time has gone by but now
Nebuchadnezzar has built a 90t by 9t
Statue of gold within the province of
Babylon that would have been placed up
on what's called a zigurat or this giant
platform for the very purpose of worship
oh and by the way the entire statue is
made out of
what
oh well do you remember the King's dream
that he had in chapter 2
king the head which is your Dynasty is
gold but your Dynasty will not last
forever and it seems as if
Nebuchadnezzar has done some reflecting
hasn't
he God gave this interpretation God in
his sovereignty and in his full power
and control has told Nebuchadnezzar what
the future will look like with the
coming kingdoms and Nebuchadnezzar goes
not on my watch I think I'll do
different because I know better than God
I'm going to make a statue of gold
representing my eternal Dynasty which I
will establish according to my
power and we see that that momentary
confession of
God was nothing but superficial
faith and it's easy for us to go oh
Nebuchadnezzar come on what a bone head
but guess who that bone head
is that's nice I was going to say me but
yeah it's it's you um it's us and here's
what I mean how many times has God in
our life revealed himself in a powerful
way answered a prayer done something
that only he can and we go oh God you're
amazing and the next week our tire goes
flat and we're like do you even
care are you even
there or with more serious ious matters
of life in which we begin to question
God do you really see and love
me do you really care about me can you
really do this cuz I don't know it's not
going the way that I would like it to
go and although Nebuchadnezzar is
completely wrong it's not hard for me to
see myself in King Nebuchadnezzar how
quickly I
forget and the reason that we often
forget is we become distracted
in the moment when God does whatever it
is he does we're in
awe but unless that draws us into
relationship with him which means
reading his word understanding who he is
and who he's called us to
be well the busyness of life will just
take over the next
day work or kids or grandkids or
building our finances or dealing with
health issues or going here or going
there and before you know it a week's
gone gone by and then 3 months and then
a year and you realize you've been
stunted in your growth and you've
forgotten what God has done and all of a
sudden you begin to build your own
golden
statues and here's what Nebuchadnezzar
is
experiencing self worship results in
superficial
Faith Nebuchadnezzar is all about self
self
Nebuchadnezzar he's all about building
his own kingdom and his own Empire and
it's evident that he doesn't have a
relationship with God because this is in
direct response to what God Said was
going to happen and Nebuchadnezzar says
no it's not I'm going to make it happen
differently it's good for us to pay
attention in our own lives are we
walking in authentic Faith or are we
walking in superficial faith and we're
going to unpack both today today as we
continue to go through this
story I want us to understand that it is
important for us to beware of building
our own
kingdoms beware of building our own
kingdoms now I don't know about
you but to me this is one of the most
difficult tensions to hold as a Believer
well what's the difference between my
kingdom and God's kingdom I mean if
we're working together shouldn't just be
his kingdom
beware of building your own kingdom
notice what Nebuchadnezzar does he
rejoices he's thankful for what God has
shown
him and then he chooses to go his own
way and we're not that different often
times we know in a dating relationship
hey I should have this sexual Fidelity
that honors Jesus I know that I've read
it I've heard it preached I've heard it
taught my parents remind me and then I
what and we go the way of the
world or we know that in business or to
be men and women of Integrity if we're
an employer we should be putting people
above
profit that flies in the face of
culture but if at the expense of making
money in our businesses we're not reveal
feeling who Jesus is in our business
practice then what in the world of
rebuilding just our own
kingdom or in family
relationships uh I don't know about you
but I really look forward to vacations
anybody else look forward to
vacations but it's so easy for me to go
okay only a month and a half left before
I get to go
here and we start missing all that God
has in between and my comfort and and my
leisure for my own family becomes
priority and now I'm building my own
kingdom instead of pursuing the
discipleship or the
discipline or the opportunity to build
others that God's putting Before Me In
The Daily Grind that I'm just trying to
get
through and I have no doubt
Nebuchadnezzar was truly in awe in that
moment but he got distracted with the
daily things that we all
do and because he wasn't rooted in God's
word and pursuing a relationship with
the Living
God anything God did in that moment was
choked out and he began building his own
kingdom Jesus speaks in Matthew 6:33 and
he says seek first the kingdom of God
and his righteousness and all these
things will be added to you
all these things doesn't mean everything
you want it means
what everything you need will be added
to you so that when you seek first God's
Kingdom in business it doesn't mean you
can't be a successful businessman or
successful businesswoman it doesn't mean
that you can't make a profit but what it
does
mean is that the way that you do it
should honor Jesus Christ so that the
people nearest to you that you employ
know that he's your lord and savior can
see something different in your business
compared to the last business that they
were at where they were treated like a
pawn or in a dating relationship as
young adults we talk about this all the
time we can either be people who take
from others and see men or women as a
conquest to have for
ourselves that would be building your
own
kingdom or you could seek first his
kingdom and his righteousness and see
that dating
opportunity as a time to Steward that
person so that whether you end up
married or whether you end up breaking
up they are closer to Jesus because you
walked in a way that honors him not easy
to do in our culture but it's what God
calls us
to consider what you are a part
of as a parent a grandparent married
single working retired pickle ball
player Beach
walker dog groomer I don't know whatever
it is God's given you something to
Steward are you building his kingdom or
are you building your
own may we walk in his ways so that we
can build his
kingdom we continue verse two and King
Nebuchadnezzar sent sent word to gather
together the satraps the administrators
the governors the counselors the
treasurers the judges the magistrates
and all the officials of the provinces
everyone who is just named there is a
person of
what a person of influence this is good
leadership on Nebuchadnezzar's part
applied in a really bad way but it's
good leadership I'm going to get all my
leaders together we're going to get them
on the same page for one purpose and
here's the
purpose to come to the dedication of the
image which King Nebuchadnezzar had set
up so the SAT traps the administrators
the governors the counselors the
treasurers the judges the magistrates
and all the officials of the provinces
gathered together for the dedication of
the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had
set up and they stood before the image
that Nebuchadnezzar had set up you get
the
picture anyone who's anyone has been
invited to this ceremony and there is
this 90t by 9ot gold statue
probably on top of something that was
already another 30 or 40 ft built up and
it would have stood out among this flat
plane in the province of
Babylon and there's thousands of
men all holding Authority and power
somewhere in the kingdom and they're
waiting and here's what they're waiting
for verse four The Herald cried aloud to
you it is commanded oh peoples Nations
and languages that at the time time you
hear the sound of the horn the flute the
harp the liar and the sultry all musical
instruments in Symphony with all kind of
music you shall fall down and worship
the gold image if you're taking notes
Circle That Word
Worship You shall fall down and worship
the gold image that King Nebuchadnezzar
has set up and whoever does not fall
down and worship shall be cast
immediately into the midst of a burning
fiery furnace
couple of things that I want to draw out
of here King Nebuchadnezzar gives a very
clear
command the moment you hear the music
you are to do
what Bow Down and Worship the image that
I have made now the Bible doesn't tell
us what the image looked like but if I'm
thinking about King Nebuchadnezzar and
there's a 90 foot statue it probably
looks like King Nebuchadnezzar he's like
whoa weird it just came out that way I
don't know what happened
but isn't it
interesting how the very things that we
often build in our own life are these
reflections of what we want to present
to other
people we may be smart enough not to
build a 90ft gold statue to
oursel but it's just so easy to get
caught up in Lifestyles or vehicles or
the types of homes we have or the body
that we have or the hairstyle that we
have or the clothes that we wear so that
we can show people this is who I am and
I'm
amazing because self worship leads to
superficial
Faith it's just faith in ourselves and
it's what Nebuchadnezzar has fallen prey
to and it's what's so easy for us to
fall
into both unbelievers and even as
Believers we can get caught up in
this interesting to me that
Nebuchadnezzar chooses to use
music as the initiating factor for
worship
now we do this on a Sunday morning we
come in we sing three to four songs for
the purpose of giving praise and honor
to our God and Savior Jesus Christ who
deserves all glory for what he has done
by paying the penalty for our
sins the music that you listen
to and the way that you worship are very
intertwined I rejected this as a
teenager and early
on don't laugh
Dad you tell your dad you tell your mom
well I just like the beat they're like
son you don't have any beat but Have you
listened to the lyrics it doesn't honor
the Lord and we go well it's just
music do you know that music is almost
always attached to worship whether it's
in the right way like we do here or
whether it's in the wrong way and if you
don't believe
me as the pastor of the young adult
community it amazes me you weren't
wearing those cowboy boots last week
yeah but I went to a Luke Bryant concert
so now I wear cowboy
boots oh hey what are your hopes and
dreams to find a girl in tiny shorts and
move to Wyoming and Ranch where' that
come from country music
baby it sounds silly but when you play
something on rep repeat over and over
and over again whatever is in it becomes
the theology that we often live by and
we don't even realize that we're doing
it and Nebuchadnezzar is a wise leader
poorly applied but a wise leader at the
sound of the theme music bow to the
Statue and really the statue is all
about who King
Nebuchadnezzar so that when you bow it
reminds me that I'm in
control that this God who is proclaimed
that my Dynasty will end I will feel
better about myself being reminded that
I'm the all powerful
one that what I do will last forever
this is flying in the face of Jesus's
Kingdom which was revealed to
Nebuchadnezzar through Daniel's
interpretation Nebuchadnezzar also uses
fear in order to drive home work worship
and it's interesting because many of the
world's religions like Islam does this
it's through fear that they bring
converts into their
religion it's within their own
scriptural writings to kill all those
who are
not part of
Islam you must convert or you must
die well Nebuchadnezzar is doing the
same thing and he's also taking
nationalism and politics and religion
and he's marrying them all together so
that if you don't bow down it's not that
you're just not worshiping the statue
it's that you're guilty of treason which
is punishable by
death and church family pay attention we
may not be being threatened yet with
fiery furnaces but there are certain
government agendas that have been
pressed upon our nation that if you do
not get in line with them you will
experience serious push back in your
workplace places you will experience
ridicule in your classes sometimes by
both your teachers and your
classmates and I believe the time is
coming where real social persecution and
possibly physical persecution will be
involved when we do not bow down to what
our government says is the law but is
truly religion in Disguise and we're
already seeing it in matters of all
sexuality aren't
we Nebuchadnezzar knows very well what
he's doing and here's the encouraging
thing to me as I read
this it reminds me of how great the
Gospel of Jesus Christ is it is an
invitation and it's rooted in the love
of Jesus who laid his life down for
hours and then took it up again after
three days and was resurrected from the
grave you cannot scare somebody into
heaven you cannot Force somebody into
heaven it must be a response to God's
love because he first loved us the
difference of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
and how powerful tyrants
work pay attention to who you vote for
for
president neither of them are
Jesus verse eight you still with me yeah
oh wait a minute no we're not going to
go to verse eight yet I got one more
thing to say
I wasn't going to I wasn't going to do
this but it's too good not to if you're
taking notes write down Revelation
13 Revelation 13 we're going to cover a
little more of this as we get in deeper
into
Daniel
but most definitely King Nebuchadnezzar
is an archetype or a type of antichrist
in Revelation chap 13 it says the dragon
the devil gives his authority to the
Beast who is the Antichrist and it is
the Beast who creates an image that must
be worshiped and if you do not worship
it you will be
killed and what's amazing is the Neo
Babylonian God during the days of
Nebuchadnezzar was Marduk and guessed
what his form was represented as a
dragon and that
Dragon gives power to Nebuchadnezzar and
Nebuchadnezzar sets up an image and if
you don't worship the image you will be
killed there are powerful parallels and
foreshadowing in Daniel that looks ahead
to the end of days during the Great
Tribulation something to wet your
appetite a little bit or if you want to
go to our uh Revelation study uh we
unpacked chapter 13 in detail and you're
more than welcome to do that throughout
the week all right verse
eight
therefore at that time
certain calans came forward and accused
the Jews anti-Semitism has been going on
for thousands of years by the
way they spoke and said to King NE
Nebuchadnezzar oh King live forever you
oh King have made a decree that everyone
who hears the sound of the horn the
flute the harp the liar the sultry in
Symphony with all kinds of music shall
fall down and worship the gold image and
whoever does not fall down and worship
shall be cast into the midst of a
burning fiery furnace I'm sure King
Nebuchadnezzar is probably a bit annoyed
that he's having his own decree repeated
to him because it's happening in the
moment he's like yeah I know I made the
decree you don't have to remind me but
then listen to what these caldan wise
men say these Babylonian wise men verse
12 there are certain Jews whom
what oh whom you have set over the
Affairs of the province of Babylon if
you're taking notes Circle whom you
these Babylonian wise men make a direct
attack on King Nebuchadnezzar it's your
leadership O King that put
these
non-compliant
unwavering unwilling to bend the knee
men and their positions what are you
going to do about
it now we know that King Nebuchadnezzar
already has a short fuse when we look at
history even outside of the Bible
and we look at Neo Babylonian history
written during Nebuchadnezzar's time he
had a really big military campaign
called The Battle of Kish against Egypt
right before he became king the best
battle he ever won but after that
Nebuchadnezzar failed on multiple fronts
to one completely overcome Egypt and two
he lost some ground in what was called
the L V area which was this area of
Mesopotamia where there was this back
and forth and people started to actually
rebel against Nebuchadnezzar's Reign
including the nation of Judah which is
why it was destroyed in 586 BC I say all
that to let you know it's likely that
King
Nebuchadnezzar was probably pretty
insecure in a lot of his
leadership and I know
this as people when we get insecure
about something and someone calls us out
how do we often
respond
defensive just
defensive
angry we we blame shift we start to
point the finger at others we give
excuses and Nebuchadnezzar is being put
to the test we're going to see his
character revealed um as a as a dad of
four kids I always feel like I'm I'm the
guy at this point in my life I used to
not be this but now after having four
kids when you're a mom and you're at the
grocery store with like a 2-year-old
like Mama cookie and Mama's like no
cookies and the kids's
like right in the middle of the
store in that moment for a lot of moms
is not oh I just want to get to the
heart of my child and make sure that we
can work this out moms what's it about
be quiet you're embarrassing me this is
horrible I can't I can't keep shopping
and then you're like why is there four
abandoned shopping carts over
here it's easy for us to become
defensive it's easy for us to be worried
about our image and
ourself and might I encourage you that
when you are in
Christ even if you do sin even if you do
make a mistake even if you're accused of
something that you didn't
do the truth of God word reminds
you that you are righteous and just
because of what Christ has done by
cleansing you from your sin you have no
need to defend
yourself you have no need to get
angry now what I'm saying is difficult
to do and I'm still trying to work on
this but what I know is that what
Nebuchadnezzar is about to display
reveals he is hardly a man of God look
with
me verse 13
then Nebuchadnezzar in Rage and fury
gave the command to bring Shadrach mhach
and abedo so they brought these men
before the
King Nebuchadnezzar spoke saying to them
is it true Shadrach mhach and abedo that
you will not serve my gods or worship
the gold image which I have set up now
if you are ready at the time you hear
the sound of the horn the flute the harp
the Li the saltry in Symphony with all
kinds of music and you fall down and
worship the image which I have made good
but if you do not worship you shall be
cast immediately into the midst of a
burning fiery furnace and then he takes
it one step
further and who is the god who will
deliver you from my
hands
wow a direct challenge a against
Shadrach mhach and Abo's God a direct
challenge against the God that he knows
interpreted the dream that Daniel gave
to
him because Nebuchadnezzar sees himself
as
how he sees himself as God more Mighty
more powerful more
affluent better wisdom and knowledge to
set the course of history and there is
no other who could possibly be above
King Nebuchadnezzar
what a challenge that Nebuchadnezzar
sets now Shadrach meach and abedo what a
response they give here we go you guys
ready verse 16 Shadrach meach and abedo
answered and said to the king oh
Nebuchadnezzar we have no need to answer
you in this
matter can you feel the temperature
rising in the
room here he is Raging Furious face
contorted these three guy he's got the
rest of the Kingdom under his thumb and
these three guys are just a splinter and
yet it has caused him to just become
repulsed and he gives this threat that
he thinks is going to beat them into
submission and they simply go we have no
need to apologize or defend
oursel and what an incredible
response look at the rest of the
response verse 7
17 excuse me yeah verse 17 if that is
the case meaning if you throw us into
the fiery furnace Our God whom we serve
is able Circle that word able to Deliver
Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he
will circle the word will Deliver Us
from your hand O
King but if not meaning if God chooses
not to rescue us let it be known to you
oh King
that we do not serve your Gods nor will
we worship the gold image which you have
set up clear as day isn't it no one's
wondering where these three men
stand they've planted their flag and
said we will not move from this spot we
worship God and we worship God alone and
there's nothing you can do to change
that and I want you to know for each one
of us in a pagan culture that is getting
further and further away from
righteousness God desires for us to
stand with the exact same
Clarity it's not difficult to come to
church or to a Bible study inside the
church walls and be a
Christian it's a blessing it's a joy we
get to fellowship with one another we
get to learn God's word we get to grow
but this is just the locker
room it's outside the the church walls
where this is supposed to be put into
practice and there shouldn't be people
in our lives guessing where we
stand now notice Shadrach Meshach and
abedo don't go looking for trouble
they're not putting a Christian flag
above their cubicle and putting the law
of Moses on their cubicle and then
saying got a problem and you know talk
to me later or whatever it is at
lunchtime I'll be outside um they're not
they're not rubbing it in people's faces
but but when it comes
time they clear as day on where they
stand for their
faith young
men when you're out and walking at the
beach nothing you can do about first
glances but you can control your second
glances and when you walk in
Integrity your friends will notice and
they will ask questions or they will say
inappropriate comments and you'll go hey
that's that's not for me and it gives
you opportunity for
conversation women if you're with other
women and they start to badmouth their
husbands are you willing to speak up and
say hey I know things are hard at home
I'm sorry and you should be holding up
your husband's arms how can I encourage
you not an easy thing to
do but the people that we are in
relationship with the people that are
our co-workers the people that we are
seeing in our neighborhoods they should
know where we stand when the opportunity
arises and here is where we see the
authentic faith of Shadrach meach and
abedo and I want to unpack five things
about their authentic Faith authentic
faith in Jesus as Lord number one does
not require excuse or
apology it does not require excuse or
apology or in other words that means you
don't have to defend yourself that
you're a Christian I used to do this all
the time there were certain movies I
wasn't allowed to watch when I was young
and my friends would be like dude why
can't you watch this movie and guess
what my reply was oh dude because I'm a
Christian that's so
lame Wow way to win people for Jesus
JC why can't you do this because I'm a
Christian why can't you do this because
I'm a
Christian I don't need to give an
excuse why don't you just get in line
with the Dei that you're supposed to do
for that test why don't you just bubble
in the right answers nobody really cares
you just need to take it and pass
it because I don't believe in it and
it's not right so therefore I'm not
going
to well give me a give me a good reason
I don't owe you a good reason I don't
answer to you I answer to God and then
you get a pink
slip authentic faith in Jesus is Lord
trust in God's sovereignty and
omnipotence omnipotence meaning that he
is all powerful look at what they say in
verse
17 if that is the case meaning if you
throw us into the fiery furnace Our God
whom we serve is both able to Deliver Us
From The Burning fiery furnace and he
will Deliver Us from your hand oh King
since you asked who's greater than you
well it's our
God now this is the part of our faith
that I think all of us want to believe
and often is the easier part of
believing can God deliver you from
anything can he heal you from anything
can he break any addiction we know this
this is true he
can the question is are we actually
living out that truth like he can we
know it up here or we know it on
paper it's not as easy to trust in God's
sovereignty
his control and his omnipotence his
power when it comes to matters that we
try to
control Nebuchadnezzar is trying to
control this whole thing Shadrach
Meshach and abedo are like
Hey we're in God's hands we're not
bowing do what you want it's in his
control now the second part that goes
with this is number three authentic
faith in Jesus as Lord submits to God's
will alone notice verse 17 and 18 have
to go hand in hand they make it clear
God is able to deliver and to Deliver Us
from your hand O King but if not meaning
they're not just assuming that God's
going to rescue them from the fiery
furnace he may choose to let them burn
but they know ultimately they're saved
for
eternity this is the harder part of
authentic faith we know God is able
yet do we receive if he chooses not
to that's authentic
Faith that's a difficult tension to
hold that's what it looks like when
Jesus teaches his disciples to pray your
will be done not
mine this is what he's Desiring to do in
each of our lives and might I say that
it happens to be the fiery furnace es of
our life that do
what they're the ones that grow us it's
the one that proves God's sovereignty
and his power the fiery furnace is the
greatest way that we grow in character
to be more like Jesus I wish that wasn't
the
case I wish I learned when things were
easy I wish I learned when I had
abundance I wish I learned
when everything was firing on all
cylinders but the reality is I learn
best when I come to the end of myself
and realize how dependent I actually am
on God because I have nothing left to
give and then he moves and I'm reminded
you are the Creator and I am the
creature you are God and I am your
servant you are my father and I am
simply your
son this is why the fiery furnace is
important number four authentic faith in
Jesus is Lord is revealed in our words
and actions they must go together King
Nebuchadnezzar at the end of chapter 2
had what he had words and they were the
right
words but there was no action there was
no fruit to go with it there was no
evidence that his life was being
transformed and for us when we look at
Shadrach mesach and abedo they say the
right words but they also follow through
on their actions and it's their
actions that speak to those around
them that make God's glory
known that helps people understand a
truth that's worth fighting for and
standing on and then lastly authentic
faith in Jesus as Lord is rooted in
relationship not religion now I want to
unpack this because if it's a it's a
little bit of a cliche statement here's
what I mean by that how did Shadrach
mesach and abedo know what to do in this
moment how did they
know come
on okay they had a relationship but
unpack that what's that
mean they knew his word they knew his
word we go back to Exodus chapter 20 God
gives Moses the Ten Commandments and the
very first two Commandments are one you
shall have no other gods but me and two
do not make for yourselves any carved
Idols do not bow down to them and do not
worship them they knew God's
word but it wasn't just following rules
for them let's go back to Daniel chapter
1 and Daniel chapter 2 in Daniel chapter
1 these men along with Daniel were faced
with the decision do we eat from the
king's table and defile what God has
told us not to eat as Jews or do we
honor him and walk
differently and and they chose to walk
differently and there was a
test hey we're going to eat just basic
grains and vegetables and water for 10
days and if you find fault in us if we
don't look healthy if we're if we're
falling short of your standards then hey
we'll get on board with your program but
God gives them favor and they're
healthier than all the other men who are
now eating from the king's table which
would have included other Jews by the
way that was God's doing they've seen
his faithfulness work and out of
response to his love for them they're
lovingly responding by walking in
obedience now Daniel chapter 2 comes
along they're all about to be
executed and Daniel and Shadrach and
mhach and abedo together go to God In
Prayer asking for something that only he
can do and God is faithful and delivers
them from the hand of King
Nebuchadnezzar and reveals both the
dream and its interpretation through
Daniel they've seen him work they've
been in relationship with him they know
that the Living God is active in their
life and that his word is true therefore
they're rooted in relationship this
isn't just following rules of a religion
of I can't because this says I
can't this is about worshiping and
responding to the loving God who's been
with them from the
beginning authentic
Faith looking at our own
lives is this what we see and if it's
not there's good
news we simply repent and go Lord
there's an area where I've got
superficial
Faith behind the scenes I'm still trying
to control I'm still trying to
manipulate I'm still trying to do things
on my
own Lord would you take that area from
me and help me to trust you and walk in
your way
and that's a prayer at the center of
God's
will it's what he will do in your
life answer the convictions and if
you're walking in authentic Faith be
encouraged by the
assurance that you are pleasing the
Lord verse 19 you still with
me the Nebuchadnezzar was full of Fury
and the expression on his face changed
towards Shadrach mesach and Abednego he
spoke and commanded that the heat that
they heat the furnace seven times more
than it was usually heated uh this
doesn't mean they increased the temp by
seven times just means they added seven
times more fuel I did some research on
modern-day brick kils they can get up to
1,825 Dees and that's probably what they
were facing you imagine this wasn't some
tanning bed gone
wrong 1,800
25° that's not far from the temperature
of the Sun
surface that's what they were facing
they would have really felt the Heat
this is real as a matter of fact it's so
important for us to remember authentic
Faith does not make us immune to fiery
trials good follow Jesus as you should
but make no mistake your life will not
get easier
you will have more joy your life will
not uh grow
calmer there'll probably be more
contention but you will know your
purpose and your value and when and
where and how to stand if you know the
Living God and you read his word which
gives you
understanding verse 20
and he commanded certain Mighty Men of
Valor who were in his army to bind
Shadrach Meshach and abedo and cast them
into the burning firy furnace then these
men meaning those three Shadrach Meshach
and abedo were Bound in their coats
their trousers their turbin and other
garments and they were cast into the
midst of the burning fiery furnace the
author wants us to make sure that we
know there was every opportunity for
them to be completely consumed
immediately by those Flames 1,800 de in
their wearing all their clothes they
should have been toast in less than half
a
second verse
23 and these three men Shadrach mhach
and Abednego fell down bound into the
midst of the burning fiery furnace I
apologize I skipped verse 22 The Men Who
Threw those three men in what happened
to them they all died because the Flames
were too great and you now have Shadrach
mesach and abedo thrown into the furnace
bound with ropes and they're on the
floor of this
furnace verse
24 then King Nebuchadnezzar was
astonished it's an
understatement and he rose in haste and
spoke saying to his counselors did we
not cast three men bound into the midst
of the fire they answered and said to
the king true oh King look he answered I
see four men loose walking in the midst
of the fire and they are not hurt and
the form of the
fourth is like the Son of God isn't it
amazing how God's using the most
prideful man on the planet to continue
to reveal
himself because Proverbs 22:1 would say
the heart of the king and the Lord's
hand is like a stream and he can direct
it wherever he wants it to
go that's the power of the Living
God I mentioned that authentic Faith
doesn't make you immune to fiery trials
but authentic Faith does save you from
bondage specifically to sin and eternal
judgment and it's what's being
represented in this story this is not
allegorical this is not metaphorical
this is a real historical event that
happened and Shadrach meach and abedo
are no longer bound walking around loose
in the midst of an 1800° burning furnace
and all of a sudden there's someone else
with them and not my words
Nebuchadnezzar's own words he looks like
a Son of God church family be
encouraged the Fourth Man in the fiery
furnace is Jesus and he is with
you he is with
you which means when you're persecuted
for righteousness sake
when you fumble and bumble your words
because you're not very eloquent and yet
you stand for truth he is with
you and when you don't capitulate to the
culture of the workplace or to your
friend group and it hurts your heart and
you find yourself in
tears he's with
you and I don't know if Shadrach Meshach
and abedo actually saw Jesus in the fire
but NE Nebuchadnezzar
did and out of everyone in that room
there's one who wouldn't lie about
someone else who would be more powerful
than him and it's
Nebuchadnezzar and he's the one who sees
the Son of God in the midst of the trial
now we could unpack this for hours
number one God usually doesn't Deliver
Us from The Trial but he does what he
does walk with you in it because that's
where you grow that's where you're built
that's where the character of Christ
makes you a formidable woman or man of
God Charles Spurgeon made an observance
about this passage he said there's some
furnaces set by man some set by Satan
some set by
God and when we worship Jesus all of
them will result in the same
outcome you will be built and refined
through the fire that God allowed you to
endure for the purpose of making you
more like
him this is what he does this is how he
builds us Isaiah 41: 10-13 I have it on
your screens let's read this all
together fear not for I am with you be
not dismayed for I am your God I will
strengthen you yes I will help you I
will uphold you with my righteous hand
behold all those who were in sensed
against you shall be ashamed and
disgraced they shall be as nothing and
those who strive With You Shall
Perish you shall seek them and not find
them those who contended with you those
who war against you shall be as nothing
as a nonexistent thing for I the Lord
your God will hold your right hand
saying to you fear not I will will help
you I don't know about you but in a room
this size there has been tremendous
hardship and
trial and in a room this size there will
be tremendous hardship and trial perhaps
for all of us certainly on a personal
level and the promises of God
stand fear not I will help you he
doesn't say fear not you won't expect
experience pain he doesn't say fear not
things won't be hard fear not you won't
have loss he says fear not I will help
you he will walk through those trials
with you and he will not leave nor
forsake
you he's been doing it since the
beginning of time he did it with
Shadrach meach and abedo he does it with
Daniel over and over again and at the
same God is the god you worship he will
do it for you this is who he
is verse
26 then Nebuchadnezzar went near the
mouth of the burning fiery furnace and
spoke saying Shadrach meach and abedo
Servants of the most high God come out
and come here then Shadrach mesach and
bedo came from the midst of the fire and
the S traps administrators Governors and
kings and counselors gathered together
and they saw these men on Whose bodies
the fire had no power the hair of their
head was not singed nor were their
garments affected and the smell of fire
was not on them the author goes to Great
Lengths to make it abundantly clear what
impact did the fire have on them
absolutely none and might I encourage
you when Jesus says you're forgiven it's
in totality not in
part don't buy into lies that say things
like I can't be forgiven for this
this well God could never accept me
because of the nothing could be further
from the
truth When God says that you're redeemed
and
Justified it doesn't mean a little bit
or only for pretty good people but
you're worse off it means in
totality it's complete just like his
Deliverance of Shadrach Meshach and
abedo wasn't just keeping them
alive it was is making it evident that
the enemy and King Nebuchadnezzar held
no power over them even down to the
smell of their
clothing that's the god that you
worship now we get to Nebuchadnezzar and
his superficial Faith verse 28
Nebuchadnezzar spoke saying blessed be
the god of Shadrach meach and abedo who
sent his Angel and delivered his
servants who trusted in him and they
have frustrated the king's word and
yielded their bodies that they should
not serve nor worship any God except
their own God does he speak the truth he
sure does but here's the problem
superficial faith it speaks of truth but
it is without personal
transformation he says all the right
things and yet he himself is
unchanged and if you're in this room
today and you go well I believe in God
or I'm a spiritual person or I I think
I'm pretty
good has there been personal
transformation through a relationship
with Jesus and the power of His word
that has caused you to turn from
sin and to pursue
righteousness has there been personal
transformation in your own life secondly
superficial Faith recognizes God's
Authority Nebuchadnezzar declares it but
it does not submit to his
ways Nebuchadnezzar is willing to go oh
once again the God of all gods but he
does not submit to God's
Authority and we see it right here he
makes this awesome confession he makes
this statement of Truth all of it is
true but then verse 29 he says therefore
I make a
decree you almost had it you're
declaring who God really is but then
Nebuchadnezzar has to oneup God doesn't
he well I decree no one cares about your
decrees how'd the last one go it didn't
mean much Nebuchadnezzar stop trying to
insert yourself stop trying to be
worshiped
yourself he says I make a decree that
any people Nation or language which
speaks anything amiss against the god of
Shadrach mhach and Abednego shall be cut
in pieces and their houses shall made an
ash Heap because there is no other God
who can deliver like this pay attention
church family superficial Faith makes
its own
laws it makes its own laws now we see
Nebuchadnezzar literally making a law if
you speak bad against the god of the
Hebrews I'll cut you into pieces and
burn your house
down Nebuchadnezzar should have been
dead in like two
days but here's what that looks like in
our own
life well I think I'm I think I'm pretty
good I mean I'm not as bad as Hitler so
I think I'll get into
heaven that's a man-made personal law
don't make your own
laws hey wife you need to do this hey
husband you need to do this hey child
you need to do this don't add to
scripture what's not
there you don't have the authority to
make
laws well my My Worship Center is uh I
go to the River or I go to the lake I'm
very spiritual I get in touch with God
in these places don't make your own
laws there is one who has made his law
and it is found in his word and if we
don't submit to his ways we will find
ourselves like
Nebuchadnezzar saying the right things
but having superficial
Faith finally superficial faith is
rooted in
self-righteousness instead of a Rel
relationship with Jesus look at the last
verse verse 30 then the king promoted
Shadrach mesach and abedo in the
province of Babylon one moment he's
throwing them into the fiery furnace and
the next moment he's promoting them even
higher than they already were because
he's trying to do what earn his favor
with them and their God because it's not
his
God it's superficial IAL
Faith it's rooted in his own
self-righteousness he's trying to earn
deserve get into the good graces however
you want to say it instead of humbling
himself before the Living
God and submitting to his
ways church
family God desires an intimate
relationship with
us sounds silly but for Shadrach Meshach
and abedo it started with some food
choices
and then seeking his face for bigger
things and then being faced with fiery
trials don't despise the day of Small
Beginnings understand that right where
God has you is where he's building you
right where God is developing you is
where you are called to say yes to his
ways because if we lie and deceive
ourselves we'll go well when it matters
if they ever put a gun to my head and
challenge me don't be fooled you will
capitulate in that day if you don't walk
in the small things that God has set
before
you he's building you walk in authentic
faith not superficial Faith the last
thing that I'll leave you with today is
that authentic Faith glorifies Jesus
Shadrach mhach and abedo have just
pointed everyone to the Lord and
everyone is in awe there's no one who
could do this except an all powerful God
and when we don't seek our own glory and
we seek the righteousness of God's
kingdom it is Jesus who will be
glorified above
all Colossians 3:4 reminds us that when
Christ is revealed when he appears again
in
glory you also will be revealed in your
glory which simply means there may be
promotions for you in this life but how
much do you think that promotion meant
to Shadrach Meshach and abedo at that
time probably
nothing the real promotion comes at the
resurrection when we will receive our
glorified bodies living in eternity with
no more pain sorrow tears or
suffering this is what God is doing in
our life amen
